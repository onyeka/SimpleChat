# SimpleChat
This is a python based simple and secure chat system which enables clients (3 for now)
chat securely using various cryptographic technologies to ensure authenticity,
confidentiality and integrity of messages sent.

This chat system has been configured to support only 3 users (clients) for now and the
chat server needs to be run to enable users connect to each other. Below are the usernames and
passwords of the pre-configured users. Ability to add new users dynamically would be added
later.

UserName                Password

Marshal09               BeNS0n*09
